    <h1>General Information</h1>
    <p>
This year W.I.S.V. 'Christiaan Huygens' will celebrate its 60th anniversary. That is why this year will be all about the 12th lustrum of the study association. This entire academic year will be filled with special and exciting activities with the recurring theme Trending.

Last year we started to spread the news with two activities, the announcement of our theme with a mural and a cantus. This year we will celebrate this lustrum with many different events. There will be 2 lustrum weeks with social events, business events and some educational workshops.

During each quarter of this year, a number of bigger events will also be hosted. Among these will be a gala, a hitchhiking competition, a symposium and the biggest event will be the hackathon. The attendees of the hackathon come up with interesting ideas based on data delivered by companies and process this in some kind of result, for instance an app or model. The most interesting results will receive a prize for their effort.

We are really looking forward to the whole year. We hope to see you at the different activities! And if you want there is also some lustrum merchandise for sale at CH.

      <h2>First lustrum week</h2>
      <h3>10 October - 14 October</h3>
      <p>
To start this year in a festive manner, we will start with lustrumweek 1. This week will begin with a grand opening with a spectacular show, after which we will enjoy a BBQ together. During the rest of the week there will be a lunch lecture by Vincent Warmerdam and a workshop by Optiver. There will be a beertasting at the Koperen Kat on wednesday evening and on friday we will end the week with a `friends from the past'-day, to show your friends from highschool what it is like to study in Delft.

      <h2>Hitchhiking competition</h2>
      <h3>19 November - 20 November</h3>
      <p>
Hitchhike to an unknown destination in Europe in a weekend! On the morning of November 19th at 9:00, the destination will be announced. The goal is to reach this city as fast as possible by hitchhiking in teams of two (male-male or male-female). When you have finally reached the city, the group will enjoy a night out! A ticket costs €25, which includes dinner and return by bus!

      <h2>Gala</h2>
      <h3>16 December</h3>
      <p>
In honour of the 12th lustrum of W.I.S.V. ‘Christiaan Huygens’ the Gala committee will organise a luxurious and chique party to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the association, the Lustrum Gala. This is the chance for the guys to show their possible dates how much of a gentleman they actually are! However, there’s a twist. This year's Gala will be held in 2016, which changes the traditions of the gala just a slight bit. Normally, men should ask their significant other to the gala, but because 2016 is a leap year, the tables have turned. Yes, ladies, this year all power is in your hands! You can now let the person you are into know what you, maybe, feel for him or her without having to throw all your feelings on the table.

On Thursday it's time to get your hands dirty with our hands-on workshop! Friday it is time to visit the Tiki Pool in Duinrell! The Tiki Pool is more than just a tropical swimming pool. Its eleven unique slides make the Tiki Pool the largest covered waterslide paradise in the Benelux! Enjoy the energetic and dynamic Tyfoon or relax on the Lazy river.
